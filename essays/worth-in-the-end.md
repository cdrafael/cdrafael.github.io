## Hassle at first

I am one of those who think of coding standards to be very tedious. However, in the long run I still believe it will be beneficial for any programmer out there. When coding, I do make sure I tab nicely, have meaningful variable names, and even make sure my code looks neat and compact. I thought I was a neat programmer, then I discovered ESLint. It made me realize how much my code was not as neat as I thought it was. After my first week of using ESLint, I realized how much of a nagging mom it could be. Seeing errors, such as, no space between the if and the parenthesis or not having an indent of 2 spaces made me very anxious to remove ESLint. I never knew there were such coding standards like this. It was very strict, however, it made it very compact and clean. Although I really didn't like the idea of having ESLint at first, I can see where it can be very beneficial in the future.

Learning the coding standard for ESLint allows me to build a good habit when writing code. Before, I would not really care is my code was symmetric, it was kind of all over the place. As long as my code worked, I thought it was fine. Now that I have a coding standard I must follow, it makes me very conscious about how I write my code. Gaining the habit of writing, compact, quality code, allows oneself to become a better programmer. The more others can read and understand your code, the more help you can get when debugging. Software Engineers should be aware of different kinds of coding standards, and should be able to adapt to many. When working for a company, you never know if they want a certain way they want their code to be written. In order for you to keep your job, you must be able to adapt to their coding standards. After my experience with ESLint, I feel that mastering the adaptability of different coding standards will help me become a great programmer, no matter who I write the code for.

Even though it pains me to see a red line underneath my if statment when im not even finished writing that line of code, ESLint will always be like a nagging mother. Having a coding standard like this, I will be able to never miss a bracket or always be able to write the most efficient code. Even though I hate it, its there for only my benefit. It will all be worth it in the end.
