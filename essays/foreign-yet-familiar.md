##First Impression

I am a Computer Engineer, so the only languages I learned were C and C++. In this class, ICS 314, we learn JavaScript. We were assigned to complete the JavaScript tutorial on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript"></i>FreeCodeCamp</a>. After the tutorial, I feel that im going to enjoy JavaScript. I have no experience with Java or JavaScript so I feel that it will be challenging. However, it will be easier to learn rather than C and C++ in my opinion. It looks like JavaScript has a lot of built in things that C and C++ don't have that can be a real pain. Take the triple equals sign for example. If I wanted to make precise conditions, I could use === to make it type sensitive (integers vs characters). Another thing I found useful and cool was using a for loop to traverse through an array using for...in (for (let x in names)). I thought for...in could be very useful in the future. I cannot wait to learn a lot more tricks in JavaScript as I go through ICS 314.

##Althetic Software Engineering

In this class we have these assignments called WODs, which stand for Workout of the Day. We are given a problem and we are tasked to solve that problem in a given amount of time. Although they sound very stressful, I enjoy these assignments. The frist WOD I did was very interesting and fun, it actually felt like a race. The pratice WODs in class and the DannyWODs (Practice WOD given by our TA) were exceptionally helpful because we were able to talk to our neighbors or the TA about questions we had. Since I am new to JavaScript I easily forgot some syntactical things and got stuck. I think in the end, once I pass ICS 314, I will be able to look back and thank my professor for all the WODs he will give. Hopefully, this concept of 'althetic software engineering' will benefit me in the future and make me a fit software developer.

Comparing JavaScipt to C and C++, I feel that I will like JavaScript more when I learn to be more proficient in writing it.
