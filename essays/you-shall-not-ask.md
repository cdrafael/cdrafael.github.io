After reading Eric Raymondâ€™s <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"> How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>, I feel that I have learned how to ask better questions on the internet. I also feel that I have learned how to detect not so smart questions. Raymond explained new skills and techniques for everyone to use in order to ask smart questions to get better results or answers. As a software developer, using the internet to ask for help will be a great way to find working on projects. Being able to interact with other developers will allow oneself to learn from them and maybe even give back and teach others.
