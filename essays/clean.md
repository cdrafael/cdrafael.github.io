## Slick

I have one word when it comes to UI Framework, clean. Ever shoot a basketball and it just has that wet swish sound? Whenver you go to the barber and look at yourself right after the cut, do you feel fresh? That's how I feel when I write my code with Semantic UI. Before Semantic UI, my code was sloppy and everywhere. After Semantic UI I love looking at the finishing product of my code. It is such a great feeling when looking at code with Semantic UI because it looks really simple in addition to being really impactful. I am a beginner HTML coder so I did not really know how to design and make websites. My first website attempts would look mediocre and clumsy and it actually made me feel sad that I would produce these kinds of websites. However, once I was introduced to Semantic UI, I was able to produce websites that were actually pleasing to the eye, all because of how simple Semantic UI made my code and how it allowed me to design and create cleaner and slicker web pages.

One thing I love about Semantic UI, are the various options I could use when designing a web page. I could contain everything using the built in ui container class. I could make my web page into a ui grid so that everything can be centered and aligned to where it looks like I actually calculated the dimensions. I know all of this can be done without Semantic UI, buts a beginner I think it's great that there is something like Semantic UI that allow me to just link something and let me use already made classes. It's like having a library in C coding. It's like having the already built in functions you dont need to make yourself and just using them. Another thing I like about UI Frameworks in general, is the ability to transfer from different local host. Like for example, your website could be accessed on your laptop and also on your phone. This meaning, the format is adaptable. Due to the different sizes of the screen, creating a web page without taking this into consideration will lead to unfriendly looking web pages on the phone. When doing a little research, I learned that with a little bit of work, you are able to have a web page that is both compatible with a laptop and a cellphone, which is a neat option.

## Future

After learning how to design and create websites using Semantic UI, I think I will continue to play around with what I can do in the future, even after this class. I think designing web pages is really fun and a great time consumer for something to do when youre bored. I think it is well worth it to learn how to use Semantic UI efficiently, in addition to many other UI Frameworks. I will definitely take a look at other UI Frameworks like Semantic UI and see what I can learn from there to become a better web designer. Im glad I was able to get exposed to HTML coding and Semantic UI.
