As a kid I really enjoyed playing with building blocks such as Legos. Although I had no idea what I was doing, stacking them up was pretty enjoyable. After reading and learning what design patterns were, I feel that building blocks are a good analogy to it. Design Patterns, according to [sourcemaking.com](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns), "is a general reapeatable solution to a commonly occuring problem in software design." Building blocks can serve as this "repeatable solution." Each and every piece can be used to serve a different purpose in the build. Each and every piece can represent different coding functions to use in a software design problem. With building blocks you are able to build all sorts of things. If we look at different kinds of building, each block could serve as a differnt item or function. We could have blocks serve as walls, windows, or doors, then have other blocks serve as functional things such as toilets, ovens, or chairs. With these blocks, there are different kind of building we could build like houses, hospitals, or schools. Each and every piece is very crucial for the creation of the building. 

However, design patterns are not finished designs because they serve as templates for how to solve a problem that can be used in many situations. This way, each building block can be a small piece of the template and
