## Caught my eye
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/apple_lamp.png">

When I was in high school I had no idea what I wanted to be. I took this class called Design Tech, where I learned how to use autoCAD. In this class, we had many design assignments. From 3D printing school focused collectables to laser printing awards for events to making lamps for teachers, this class sparked my interest in the process in which we took design and build. In addition to Design Tech, I also played a lot of video games during my free time in high school. Theres always this interest in game development thats been in the back of my mind, yet I have not pursued it. I then decided to take Computer Engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This was the start of my college adventure.

## Little by little

My first semesteer of college was pretty boring, I only took gen ed classes. At that moment I thought of college as 'something I just needed to get over with.' Then I took EE160, which was Programming for Engineers. This was my very first programming class, we learned C. After taking this class, I thought coding was the coolest thing ever. I began looking forward to all my future classes that also dealt with programming. This changed my view of college. Now college to me is 'something I just need to get over with and learn programming.' In my junior year I now know C and C++, in addition to a few projects like the UH Manoa Shaka Scheme and Micromouse under my belt. In Computer Engineering, the only designing we really did in class were final projects. That is why I think ICS 314 will be a great experience for me. 

## Software Engineering

To me software engineering has a lot to do with designing. ICS 314 is the first class im taking that focuses on that. As a Computer Engineer, we rarely get classes that are so interactive and motivated. The professor is really passionate about this class, and I think im going to enjoy it because I feel this class will really push me, unlike my engineering classes that are full of boring lectures. Some skills I hope to learn in this ICS314 are new techniques to hone my programming skills, designing skills that will help me have a creative mind, and communication skills because communicating with a group of people for a coding project is very key for successful projects. Now that I learned some things in college, im still interested in programming, web designing/managing, networking, and game development. However, I have little experience with a lot of these thing, I hope to gain more experience through classs, projects, and internships/jobs.
