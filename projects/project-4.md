Look 'N' Cook is a small website that allows users to share and view recipes within a community of users. The full team consisted of me and two other students in a Software Engineering class. Look 'N' Cook had multiple functionalities. The main function is to add recipes for other users to view. These recipes would contain basic information such as a description, and image, ingredients, dietary restrictions, and the steps to create the recipe. There would be another type of user, which would be vendors. Vendors were able to establisht their company and create a list of ingredients that are on sale. Students would then be able to view the prices of these ingredients on a page and be able to compare the prices between the different vendors. We also implemented a review section for each recipe. In this section, users are able to comment on other users recipes in addition to addint a rating out of 5 stars on what they think about the recipe.
