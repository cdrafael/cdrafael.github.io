In my church we have a group called the TRG, which stands for the technical resource group. We deal with the streaming, cabling, A/V, and technical aspects in our church. Through various activities held at places such as Neal Blaisdell Concert Hall or at our very own chapels, We take care of the brodcasting of the events. From these different events I learned how to use various equipment in addition to some cabling techniques. We use webex to stream church services from different parts of the world to our very own chapel. Our job is to feed the audio from the stream into our speakers via a mixer and to supply the video through different displays/tvs set up throughout our chapel. We have been doing this for about 3 years now and our setup has been upgrading slowly and becoming more and more efficient.

To display the video to all the tvs we use an hdmi splitter to display to up to 9 tvs. Sometimes the service is in filipinos so we have to feed both the english and filipino audio. To do this we use a mixer. With our set up we have a bunch of cat6, hdmi, usb, and xlr chords inside the walls of our chapel. I was able to gain many skills about streaming, A/V, and
